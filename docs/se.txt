Read And understand @/**/*.ts, @/**/*.tsx, @/**/*.mjs, @/**/*.json , @/**/*.mts, @/**/*.json @/**/*.md, @/**/*.txt,   @/**/*.yml,   @/**/*.ps1, @/**/*.sh, @/**/*/Dockerfile, @/src, @scripts and the overall structure of the project.
After fully understanding the project, Request all necessary permissions before proceeding with the tasks if needed. and Confirm if I have the necessary permissions to proceed with these tasks and All the necessary permissions for PowerShell execution, Perform the following  tasks the bests way you recommend, only use a script if manually edits fail or bulk processing is needed and if a script is needed to perform any of the tasks create the script in @/scripts and make sure to optimize then validate before running the script for performance and best practices and document the script with comments for better understanding, the package manager is pnpm  and the system is windows use do not repeat yourself practices dont create a script if not needed. dont create summary or explanation just perform the tasks as requested.
Tasks:
1 - Optimize and Validate if exists update file to an optimized version of @next.config.ts, @eslint.config.ts, @.prettierrc.ts, @postcss.config.mjs, @*config.ts to ensure it follows best practices and is properly configured for this project.
2 - Optimize and Validate if exists update file to an optimized version of the project seeding system in @/src/database/seed/**/*.ts to be dynamic allowing the creation of data from my @users.json @data.json @chapters.json @comics.json  @chaptersdata.json @comicsdata.json @chaptersdata*.json @comicsdata*.json   implement its route for crud operations and zod validation, create all custom mutations and queries to ensure the inserted data is being created or updated if it exists  ensure all images are being downloaded use do not repeat yourself practices.
3 - Optimize and Validate if exists update file to an optimized version of next-auth user to reflex the user in @/src/database/schema.

6 - Optimize and Validate if exists update file to an optimized version of   all declarations, reference, modules, types and interfaces for @.ts and @.tsx files  to ensure type safety and consistency across the codebase and use do not repeat yourself practices in @/src/types/*.d.ts @/src/types/*.ts  files with@/src/types/*.d.ts @/src/types/*.ts  files with proper naming conventions update @.ts and @.tsx files  to use new types at @/src/types/*.d.ts @/src/types/*.ts delete all old or unused types files .
7 - Optimize and Validate if exists update file to an optimized version of custom path alias  in @/tsconfig.json for better module resolution and cleaner imports and exports throughout the project update all @.ts and @.tsx files to the new custom path alias  use do not repeat yourself practices.
8 - Create and Run once created and validated  a scripts to Perform an update all  @.ts, @.tsx files and functions to   use CamelCase change filename to use CamelCase where applicable for better readability and consistency, Refactoring of the folder structure for better maintainability and
9 - Create and Run once created and validated  a scripts to Perform a cleanup of the project which  prevent duplicates, deleting unused or duplecate files, functions, Delete all files that ends with .backup, Delete all unused Components,Scripts that are not being used.
10 - Uninstall all unused packages from @package.json.
11 - Fix all type-check and linting errors and warnings manually use do not repeat yourself practices.
12 - Create an Optimize .github/prompts/Setup.prompt.md if exists update the file  with all the content,tasks, todos, recommendations from @.md, @.txt, @.ts, @.tsx, @.mjs, @.json , @.mts, @.json @.yml   @.ps1 @.sh @Dockerfile files  as Github copilot cli Prompts for a complete setup of this project and scaffolding all necessary files, components, pages and codes   setup handler for long running functions.
13 - Create a comprehensive README.md for the project that includes setup instructions, usage guidelines, contribution instructions, and any other relevant information.
