7 - Optimize and Validate if exists rename file to end with .backup then delete the old file and create an enhanced version of  all  any types to  the correct specific types or update function to be generic with the correct specific types in all @.ts and @.tsx files across the project for better type safety and code quality.
8 - Optimize and Validate if exists rename file to end with .backup then delete the old file and create an enhanced version of custom paths in @/tsconfig.json for better module resolution and cleaner imports throughout the project.
9 - Optimize and Validate if exists rename file to end with .backup then delete the old file and create an enhanced version of @/scripts/update-imports-to-aliases.ts to ensure all import and export paths are updated according to the new custom paths  defined in @/tsconfig.json.
